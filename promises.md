# Asynchronous & Synchronous Programming in NodeJs

## What is Asynchronous Programming in NodeJs?

- Asynchronous programming is a design pattern which ensures that the program does not get blocked while waiting for the response from an API or a database query.

## What is the difference between synchronous and asynchronous programming?

- In synchronous programming, the program waits for the response from an API or a database query before executing the next line of code. In asynchronous programming, the program does not wait for the response and continues executing the next line of code.

## What are promises in NodeJs?

- Promises are a way to handle asynchronous operations in JavaScript.

## How do promises work in NodeJs?

- Promises are objects that represent the eventual completion or failure of an asynchronous operation. They can be in one of three states: pending, fulfilled, or rejected.
