# MongoDB

## What is MongoDB

MongoDB is a NoSQL database that stores data in flexible, JSON-like documents.

## Why MongoDB

MongoDB is a popular choice for many modern web applications because it can be scaled across multiple servers, has built-in replication, and can be used as a file storage system.

## Pros & Cons

### Pros

- **Schema-less**: MongoDB is a document database in which one collection holds different documents. Number of fields, content, and size of the document can differ from one document to another.

- **Indexing**: MongoDB supports secondary indexing, which can be used to improve the performance of searches.

- **Replication**: MongoDB can provide high availability with replica sets. A replica set consists of two or more copies of the same data.

- **Sharding**: MongoDB uses sharding to scale horizontally by splitting data across multiple MongoDB instances.

- **Ad-hoc queries**: MongoDB supports search by field, range queries, and regular expression searches.

### Cons

- **No Transactions**: MongoDB does not support multi-document transactions.

- **Memory Usage**: MongoDB can use a lot of memory.

- **No Joins**: MongoDB does not support joins.

- **No Constraints**: MongoDB does not support constraints.
