# What is SCRUM

SCRUM is a framework that helps teams work together. Much of the framework is defined by a set of roles, responsibilities, and meetings that never change. The SCRUM team is made up of a Product Owner, the Development Team, and a Scrum Master. The SCRUM team works together to deliver the product incrementally. The SCRUM team is self-organizing and cross-functional. The SCRUM team is responsible for delivering the product incrementally.

## Roles in SCRUM (Components of SCRUM)

### Product Owner

The Product Owner is responsible for maximizing the value of the product and the work of the Development Team. How this is done may vary widely across organizations, Scrum Teams, and individuals.

### Development Team

The Development Team consists of professionals who do the work of delivering a potentially releasable Increment of "Done" product at the end of each Sprint. Only members of the Development Team create the Increment.

### Scrum Master

The Scrum Master is responsible for promoting and supporting Scrum as defined in the Scrum Guide. Scrum Masters do this by helping everyone understand Scrum theory, practices, rules, and values.

## Tickets

Tickets are the tasks that are assigned to the Development Team & Product Owner for review. The Development Team works on these tickets to deliver the product incrementally.

### Tickets lifecycle

1. **To Do**: The ticket is in the backlog and is not yet assigned to a developer & without story points, not in a sprint.

2. **In Progress**: The ticket is assigned to a developer and is being worked on.

3. **Testing**: The ticket is ready for testing by the quality assurance team.

4. **In Review**: The ticket is ready for review by the Product Owner.

5. **Done**: The ticket is completed and is ready to be deployed.

## Story Points

Story points are a unit of measure for expressing an estimate of the overall effort that will be required to fully implement a product backlog item or any other piece of work. When estimating with story points, a team is estimating the relative effort required to implement a product backlog item.

## Sprint

A Sprint is a time-box of one month or less during which a "Done", useable, and potentially releasable product Increment is created. Sprints have consistent durations throughout a development effort. A new Sprint starts immediately after the conclusion of the previous Sprint.

## Sprint Planning

Sprint Planning is a time-boxed event that occurs at the beginning of the Sprint. The purpose of Sprint Planning is to define what can be delivered in the Sprint and how that will be achieved. Sprint Planning is time-boxed to a maximum of eight hours for a one-month Sprint. For shorter Sprints, the event is usually shorter.

## Daily Standup

The Daily Standup is a 15-minute time-boxed event for the Development Team to synchronize activities and create a plan for the next 24 hours. This is done by inspecting the work since the last Daily Scrum and forecasting the work that could be done before the next one.

## Retrospective

The Sprint Retrospective is an opportunity for the Scrum Team to inspect itself and create a plan for improvements to be enacted during the next Sprint.

## Grooming

Product Backlog refinement is the act of adding detail, estimates, and order to items in the Product Backlog. This is an ongoing process in which the Product Owner and the Development Team collaborate on the details of Product Backlog items.
