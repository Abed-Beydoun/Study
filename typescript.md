# Typescript

## What is Typescript

TypeScript is a superset of JavaScript that adds type annotations and, therefore, type checking to the language. This means that you can write TypeScript code that looks like JavaScript code, but with the added benefit of type checking.

## Why Typescript

TypeScript is a powerful tool that can help you write better code. It can catch bugs before they happen, make your code more readable, and help you write more maintainable code.

## How to install Typescript

You can install TypeScript using npm. Run the following command to install TypeScript globally on your machine:

```bash
npm install -g typescript
```

## Typescript Base Types

TypeScript has several built-in types that you can use to define variables. Here are some of the most common ones:

- `number`: A number, either an integer or a floating-point number.
- `string`: A string of characters.
- `boolean`: A boolean value, either `true` or `false`.
- `array`: A type that represents a non-primitive type.
- `void`: A type that represents the absence of a value.
- `null`: A type that represents a null value.
- `undefined`: A type that represents an undefined value.
- `any`: Any type, useful when you don't know the type of a variable. BUT AVOID USING IT.

## How to compile Typescript

You can compile TypeScript code using the `tsc` command. Run the following command to compile a TypeScript file:

```bash
tsc yourfile.ts // This will compile yourfile.ts to yourfile.js
```

## How to run Typescript

You can run TypeScript code using the `node` command. Run the following command to run a TypeScript file:

```bash
node yourfile.js // This will run yourfile.js
```
